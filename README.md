# Cloud Survey Sample
The Cloud Survey sample demonstrates how to build modern web applications using the latest tools such as ASP.NET MVC 4, Ember.js, and SignalR. This sample consists of a survey designer page, a survey page, and a survey summary page. Each of the pages uses Ember.js to update the UI in real time and perform data binding. The survey summary page also uses SignalR to update the survey results in real-time as surveys are completed.

This sample is designed to be deployed to Windows Azure Web Sites and uses a Windows Azure SQL Database for persistence. You can run this site in either shared or reserved mode on Windows Azure Web Sites with any number of instances.
